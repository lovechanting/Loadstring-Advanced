# Loadstring-Advanced
Sophisticated loadstring system easy and optimized to use then the 100+ Buffer overflow Roblox loadstring hook!

***Example:***

```local LoadstringLib = loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lovechanting/Loadstring-Advanced/refs/heads/main/loadstring-advanced.lua"))()
local scriptURL = "your-github-raw-libary"

LoadstringLib.Execute(scriptURL, { exampleArg = "Load for Pet Simulator 99." })```

-- Loadstring-Advanced is designed to push Roblox scripting further by making execution more dynamic. For example, you can create a local string that changes based on PlaceId, dynamically sending arguments to your script. Your script can then process these arguments to determine how it executes, bringing modern, adaptive scripting with lower payload overhead.
